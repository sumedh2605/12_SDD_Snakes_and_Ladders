Thank you for installing Snakes & Ladders! We hope this video game transports you back to your childhood, allowing you to experience the highs and lows that come from this iconic board game with up to 3 other friends.
You no longer have to worry about any pieces going missing or the board tiles fading away - you can now play this game from the comfort of your own computer, even on the go without needing to carry around a bulky set.

Instructions:
To play the game download the installer and follow instructions to create the application on your computer.
To begin using the game click the Start button.
Choose the amount of players taking part in the game from 2-4.
To begin playing Snakes & Ladders, click the blue play button which will roll the die for the first player.
The game will finish once all players have reached 100 and display a leaderboard showing all the statistics for the players.
Avoid spam clicking any buttons to prevent CPU overload.

How the game works:
Each player will roll two dice when it is their turn.
When a player lands on a snake, their position will be transported to the end of the snake.
When a player lands on a ladder, their position will be transported to the top of the ladder.
When a player is within range of reaching 100 they must roll the exact or less than the number of steps needed to reach 100 else their turn is skipped.
To win the game the player must reach the 100 tile first and the other player(s) will continue until they too reach 100.
